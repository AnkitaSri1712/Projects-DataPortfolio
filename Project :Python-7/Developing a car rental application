The Car Rental System project simulates a simple car rental shop where customers can rent cars on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. 
The system is implemented in Python using object-oriented programming concepts. It consists of two main classes: CarRental and Customer.The CarRental class manages the rental operations and inventory of cars available in the shop. 
It allows customers to check available stock, rent cars on different time bases (hourly, daily, weekly), return cars, and calculates bills based on the rental duration and type.
