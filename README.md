Project 1:Electric Vehicle Market Analysis

~ Having potential benefits like significantly fewer emissions, lower repair and maintenance costs, cheaper to fuel than conventional gas vehicles, electric vehicles are getting popularity all over the world. This project analyzes Electric vehicle market in USA, by taking into consideration the dataset which consists of detailed information such as Model year, Model type, Electric Range etc. The purpose is to understand EV market through a decade and predict future vehicle market for EVs and their manufacturers.



Project 2:Customer Behaviour Analysis 

~This project revolves around analysing customer behaviour and segmentation within an e-commerce context using Python and various data visualization techniques. 
It identifies potential areas for improvement such as reducing churn rate and optimizing customer engagement strategies. Overall, the analysis provides actionable insights aimed at enhancing business growth and profitability in the e-commerce domain.



Project 3: Supply Chain Analysis 

~This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of a company's supply chain using Python and visualization libraries such as Plotly. The analysis provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain operations, improving product profitability, and enhancing customer satisfaction through efficient logistics and quality management strategies. The visualizations and metrics derived from the analysis offer a comprehensive overview aimed at supporting strategic decision-making within the company's supply chain management.

Project 4: Sports Analysis 

~This project aims to analyze a cricket match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Delhi Capitals (DC) using data from innings deliveries. Various aspects of the game are explored, including batting performance, bowling effectiveness, partnership analysis, phase-wise scoring rates, dismissal types, and pivotal moments. The analysis provides insights into team strategies, player performances, and key moments that influenced the match outcome.

Project 5: Profit Prediction

~This project aims to analyze and predict the profitability of startups based on their spending patterns in different areas such as R&D, Administration, and Marketing. The dataset used contains information about 50 startups including their expenditures and location (State). The main goal is to build a predictive model using linear regression to understand which factors most significantly influence a startup's profit.

Project 6: Decision tree algorithm(ML)

~In this project, we aim to build a classification model to predict the safety of cars based on various attributes. The dataset used contains information on car attributes like buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity, trunk size, and safety features, along with the safety classification as 'unacceptable', 'acceptable', 'good', or 'very good'. This showcases the application of Decision Tree classifiers for multiclass classification tasks using Python's machine learning ecosystem, emphasizing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

Project 7: Developing a Car rental application

~The Car Rental System project simulates a simple car rental shop where customers can rent cars on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. The system is implemented in Python using object-oriented programming concepts. It consists of two main classes: CarRental and Customer.The CarRental class manages the rental operations and inventory of cars available in the shop. It allows customers to check available stock, rent cars on different time bases (hourly, daily, weekly), return cars, and calculates bills based on the rental duration and type.


Project 8: Developing a shopping application

~The Online Shopping System project facilitates an interactive platform for both administrators and users to manage and engage in shopping activities. Implemented in Python, it employs object-oriented programming principles to model users, administrators, categories of items, individual items, carts, and payment methods. This project demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming concepts applied to simulate a comprehensive online shopping experience
