Project 11: Developing a cosmetic recommendation system

~Tools/Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, t-SNE, Bokeh
•	Developed a content-based recommendation system for cosmetic products, using chemical ingredient lists to recommend similar items to consumers with different skin types.
•	Processed raw ingredient data (1472 cosmetic products) through tokenization, creating a document-term matrix (DTM) to represent ingredient presence.
•	Applied t-SNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce dimensionality of the high-dimensional ingredient matrix and visualize product similarity in two dimensions.
•	Visualized product similarity using Bokeh, creating an interactive plot to explore similar products based on ingredient overlap.
•	Drew insights into cosmetic product similarities and potential alternative products for consumers, allowing them to make more informed purchase decisions based on ingredient matching.



Project 12: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of lightning, snow, and various weather conditions.

~ Collected and preprocessed a dataset of weather images, applying data augmentation (rotation, flipping, normalization) for robustness.
Built and trained the CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras, optimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning.
Achieved high classification accuracy using transfer learning (ResNet, VGG16) and evaluated results with precision, recall, and F1-score.




Project 13: Performed stock Price Direction Prediction using Support vector machine ML algorithm

Built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict stock price direction (up/down) based on historical market data.
